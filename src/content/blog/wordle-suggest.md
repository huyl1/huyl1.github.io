## Features

wordleSuggest is a chrome extension that adds autocomplete to your Worlde game. The autocomplete is
seemlessly integrated into the game. Published on the [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wordle-suggest/gglbpeofjcjkofejocefcncolhkldhom).
This extension longer works due to a lack of updates.

- Fast autocomplete, based on the prefix typed.
- The user can cycle through remaining autocomplete options using TAB
